Group SAX outperformed SAX with higher word size
	- BirdChicken (2 classes, low alpha group sax outperformed at high word size)
	- Car (4 classes, only slight outperform, ~= euc)
	- Lighting2 (2 classes, G-SAX spiked for high alpha, otherwise meh)
	- MiddlePhalanxOutlineCorrect (2 classes, G-SAX best for a=16,32)
	- Plane (7 classes, G-SAX stayed very competitive, outperf low alpha)

Group SAX underperformed
         - 50words (50 classes)
         - ArrowHead (3 classes, only slightly)
	 - Beef (5 classes, at low word size G-SAX was a little better)
	 - BeetleFly (2 classes, low alphabet outperformed)
	 - CBF (3 classes, High alpha best, G-sax better for lowest alpha)	
	 - Coffee (2 classes, high alpha best, G-sax better for lower alpha)
	 - ECG200 (2 classes, high alpha best)
	 - Fish (7 classes, higher alpha => better results)
	 - Ham (2 classes, G-SAX generally lower)
	 - Lighting7 (7 classes, G-SAX had spikes, but wasn't generally better)
	 - MiddlePhalanxOutlineAgeGroup (3 classes, high alpha best, but big spike for G-SAX)
	 - ShapeletSim (2 classes, G-SAX had spike at w=8, but sax outperf)
	 - synthetic_control (6 classes, high alhpa best, outperf G-SAX and euc)

SAX underperformed
 - Adiac (37 classes)
 - Meat (3 classes, but G-SAX for a=32 best)
 - MoteStrain (2 classes, G-SAX outperformed, but still a little less than euc)
 - OliveOil (4 classes, dismal SAX performance)
 - Trace (4 classes, high alpha best, g-sax had spike at w=6, still a little less than euc)
